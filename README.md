# 📊 Full-Stack SaaS Dashboard (Admin Panel / Analytics Tool)

This project is a modern, responsive admin dashboard designed for SaaS platforms, providing real-time analytics, data visualizations, and management tools. Built using a scalable tech stack with React and Tailwind CSS, it's ideal for tracking KPIs, managing users, and monitoring system health.

  - `components/`: Reusable UI components (cards, charts, navbars, tables, etc.).
  - `context/`: Global state management using React context.
- `index.html`: App container.
- `vite.config.ts`: Vite configuration.
- Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive design.

**Backend (To Be Integrated)**
